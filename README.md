AI model for weather classification involves developing a system that can categorize weather conditions like sunny, rainy, snowy, or cloudy. The process starts with defining the objective and collecting diverse datasets, which can include images from satellites or ground-based stations, sensor data (temperature, humidity, wind speed, pressure), and textual weather reports. The collected data is then preprocessed to handle missing values, normalize sensor readings, and annotate images. Feature extraction techniques are applied to highlight relevant patterns. For image data, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are often used due to their effectiveness in recognizing visual patterns. Sensor and text data might be processed using traditional machine learning algorithms or natural language processing (NLP) techniques, respectively. The model is then trained, validated, and tested using these datasets to ensure accuracy and robustness. Finally, the AI system is deployed, providing real-time weather classification and contributing to applications like weather forecasting, agricultural planning, and disaster management.
